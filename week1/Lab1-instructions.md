## Instructions for Lab1

1. Go to this URL to accept assignment: [https://goo.gl/iXjYm7](https://goo.gl/iXjYm7).

2. Github will create a repository for you.  Copy the URL on the repository page.

3. Clone the repo into your IDE workspace.  For eclipse, its usually a directory name "workspace".
    ```shell
    cmd> cd someplace/workspace
    cmd> git clone https://github.com/OOP2018/guessing-game-yourname.git guessing-game
    ```
4. Complete assignment according to these instructions: [Guessing Game](Lab1-Guessing-Game.pdf). 

## Check Your Code

1. Do classes have good Javadoc with `\@author` tag and your real name?
2. Can your `GameConsole` play someone else's game?
3. Can anyone else play your GuessingGame in **their** GameConsole?
4. Can your `GameSolver` solve someone else's game?

## Push and Verify

1. Push to Github.
2. Verify that all the classes are there (view on Github).

## Look on Github for "Issues" and Fix Them (Sunday or Monday)

TAs and instructor will check your project.

If anything needs to be fixed, we post an **issue** in your Github repository.

You should fix all issues and **close** each issue.
