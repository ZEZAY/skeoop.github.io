Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences
by Rene Descartes (simplified punctuation)

Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every 
one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the 
most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger 
measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely 
that all are mistaken the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the 
power of judging aright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is 
properly what is called good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men. And 
that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being 
endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we 
conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the 
same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime 
requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the 
highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations. And those 
who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep 
always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.
