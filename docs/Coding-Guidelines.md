## General Coding Guidelines for all Languages

* Code Should be Easy to Read
  * Use whitespace for readability
  * Use a naming standard
  * Consistent intentation and formatting
* Comments where needed.  This includes all class and method Javadoc.
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) - avoid duplicate code and duplicate logic
* Avoid magic numbers in code 
* Avoid string literals in code for things that represent specific values
* One purpose for each variable
* Each method does only one thing
* Use descriptive names and avoid abbreviations
* Avoid global variables
* Return results, don't print them
* Fail fast (return error or throw exception when data or params are invalid)


These guidelines are similar to the style standard
in the MITx course [Software Construction in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.005.1x+3T2016/),

## Code Review

Professional developers (and serious volunteer developers) do code reviews!

You should review all your code, repeatedly.
