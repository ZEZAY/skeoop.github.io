# Design Patterns

*Design Patterns* are reusable designs for a common situations. 

Each design pattern consists of:

* Context - a situation where a design solution is needed
* Forces (or Motivation) - motivation or "needs" of the situation
* Solution - a design that solves the problem
* Applicability - when the pattern applies.  There may be many solutions to a particular context; the applicability can help.
* Consequences - good and back effects of this solution
* Example - each pattern has at least one example of its use

Design Patterns are motivated by some Design Goals and Principles.
Software is plagued by:

* change - requirements change, technology changes, the environment where software is used changes
* bugs (errors)
* complexity

These forces have given rise to some *principles* for good design and coding.

You can become a better programmer by studying the patterns and principles behind the patterns.

Design Patterns we will study in this course are:

* Adapter - change the iterface of an object
* Command - separate the requester of a behavior from the invoker of the behavior by encapsulating it
* Decorator - add or enhance a behavior without modifying existing classes
* Facade -
* Factory Method - encapsulate object creation and make it polymorphic
* Iterator - a mechanism for iterating over a group of objects without knowing the structure of the group
* Observer - also called Publish - Subscribe
* Singleton - ensure that only one instance of a class is created
* State - change an object's behavior depending on state (without using "if")
* Strategy - an interchangeable set of algorithms for performing some task
 
The "king" of design patterns is Model-View-Controller (MVC), but its also a bit hard to grasp at first.  We may study it if time permits.

## References to Learn More

There's lots of design patterns material on the web.

For an in-depth explanation, two good books for Java programmers are:

* _Design Patterns Explained_ by Shalloway and Trott.
* _Head First Design Patterns_. Has memorable and entertaining examples, but the example code is too simple.
