## Homework: Efficient Video Settings for OBS

### Due: 10:00AM Sunday, 26 April. Please submit early if you can.

Learn and experiment with video and streaming settings in OBS
that effect the video size and data-rate used for streaming.

The purpose is to find settings that will result in a small
video size and streaming rate, subject to the requirement that
the text on the screen be readable. We will use these settings
for screen-casting during exams.

Submit a Google Doc with two sections that explains your results
so that others can understand.  Document should fit on one page.
Include sections:

### 1. Recommended Settings

The recommended video and stream settings.  
Can be a single value or range of values.

You can include other things that students can do to reduce the
video size, too.

No credit for copying matieral from the document I previously posted
about video streaming.

### 2. Explanation

Brief explanation of which settings have the greatest effect on
in file size and stream rate, 
and how they effect the viewability of the screen-cast.

For example, setting some things too low many make the video hard
to view.
