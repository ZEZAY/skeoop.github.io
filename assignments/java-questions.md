## Java Questions

* [ ] Compiles Java source code into byte code.
* [ ] Loads Java byte code into memory.

Q2. 


## Java Numeric Classes

Q3. What are the values of x and y?  Explain why.
```java
double x = 5/2;
double y = 5.0/2;
```

Q4. What is the value of n?
```java
int m = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int n = m + 1;
```

Q5. Which of these assignments is allowed in Java?
```java
float  f1 = 10;
float  f2 = 10.0;
double d1 = 10;
double d2 = 10.0/0.0;
int    n1 = 10;
int    n2 = 10.0;
long   m1 = 10;
int    n3 = m1;
```

Q5. To store the population of the Earth (approx. 7.53 billion) as an integer value (not floating point), what datatype should we use?
```java
# You can put _ in numbers to make them more readable, e.g. 1_000 is 1000.
__________ population = 7_530_000_000;
```
but the above code will cause an error even when you use the correct datatype for `population`!  How to fix the error?

Q6. The Python `float` type is most similar to which of these Java types? (Can you explain why?)

* [ ] `float`

* [ ] `double`
* [ ] `Double`
* [ ] `BigDecimal`

## Arrays

Q7. Which of these statements creates an array of 8 string variables?
* [ ] `String[8] s = new String[]`
* [ ] `String s = new String[8]`
* [ ] `String *s = new String[8]`
* [ ] `String[] s = new String[8]`
* [ ] `String[] s = new String(8)`

Q8. After running this code, what is the value of `names[0]`?
```java
String[] names = new String[10];
```
* empty string ("")
* `None`
* `null`
* 0
* undefined (could be any value)
