## Assignment for Week 1

### 1. Learn Java Syntax

Learn as much of the basic Java syntax as you can.
Try to read all of Chapter 1, "[A Crash Course in Java](../docs/OODP-Chapter1.pdf)"
from the book *Object-Oriented Design & Patterns*, 2nd ed.

If there is some part you don't understand then learn more about it at one of these sources:

* [W3Schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [Oracle Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
* [Think Java][ThinkJava] similar to the "Think Python" book in Programming 1
* [Big Java][OOBOOKS] by Cay Horstmann
* Any Java book you like. There are many Java books in Thai, too.

or search Google, and let me know any good sources you find!


### 2. Answer These Questions about Java

(To be Added this weekend)

### 3. Learn to Use the Command Line on Your Computer

You should become familiar with basics of using a command or terminal window:

1. the directory structure (tree) on your computer
2. how to get the name of the "current directory" your command shell (terminal) is using
3. how to change to another directory.  To go to a parent directory (one level up) the command is `cd ..` or `chdir ..`. 
4. how to list all the files in a directory (usually `dir` or `ls`)
5. how to list all files, including "hidden" files (`dir /a` or `ls -a`)
6. how to rename a file
7. how to move a file to another directory, or delete a file
8. how to create a directory
9. how to edit a file using a text editor
10. what is the PATH and what is it used for?
11. how do modify the PATH or view its value


### 4. Complete the Guessing Game Lab

Instructions: [Lab1-Guessing-Game](https://skeoop.github.io/assignments/Lab1-Guessing-Game.pdf)

You will use **git** to submit your code to Github Classroom.
Follow these steps:

1. Accept the assignment on Github: [Lab1 Assignment](http://bit.ly/OOP2020-lab1)
2. Step 1 creates a repository on Github containing starter code.  Click on the link shown to go to your repository.  The URL of your repository will be similar to:    
   `https://github.com/OOP2020/lab1-your_github_id`
3. When you see your `lab1` Github repo, click on the **Clone or download** link.  
4. Copy the URL to "Clone using HTTPS".
5. Open a command window (Windows Cmd or Mac Terminal) and change to a directory where you would like to create the "lab1"  directory.
    > When you clone, it will create a new directory **inside** your current directory
6. Clone the directory from the URL you copied in step 4:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OOP2020/lab1-your-github-id.git
    ```
7. Do the assignment and test your work.
8. Bring to it class next week.
9. If you would like to save your work to Github (a good idea, you can do this many times) then see the slides on git.  
   You need to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` ("push" your work to Github).
