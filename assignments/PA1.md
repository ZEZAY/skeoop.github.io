## Programming Assignment 1

Due: **Saturday, 29 Feb, midnight**

Implement one of these programs.  You can submit either one, but not both.

1. ArrayIterator - a class that iterates over an array, skipping nulls.
    * This is easy. Requires about 15 lines of code, not counting imports.
    * Good practice using Iterator, a "cursor" to keep track of position, and throwsing an exception.

2. CSVReader - a class for reading data in CSV format. It parses lines and returns each line as an array of Strings using the Iterator interface.
    * This is more work, but you will learn how to read from a file and parse data using String.split() or StringTokenizer.
    * Practice using Iterator, throwing exceptions, using BufferedReader.
    * Requires 20-30 lines of code.

### Test Code

You should carefully review and test your own code. Don't depend on instructor-provided tests.  In grading we may use different tests.

* CSV Reader: please contact me for test code

### Submit Early to Get Feedback

If you submit early and send email to TA and instructor, we will try to give some useful feedback so you can revise your code.
