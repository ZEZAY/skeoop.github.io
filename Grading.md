## "How Many Points is xxx Worth?"

Every semester students ask lots of questions about how many points this or that is worth, or how many points to get a grade.  Usually, these same students **never** ask a single question about the material in the course.

A grade should indicate how much you know and your ability to apply it.  Its not just how many points you got.

Kasetsart U. is a scarse and expensive national resource.  Society pays for it to help provide people with the knowledge & abilities important to the nation.  Software Engineers need the ability to write correct code for complex problems (harder than "buy-1-get-1-free").  Scores should honestly reflect your progress toward this goal, even if they are sometimes disappointing.  

I hope you use your score as feedback on what to improve on.
