## Lab 14 Part 1: Video Streaming

To get credit for this lab, demonstrate to TA that you can Live Stream your screen and upload a video recording afterward.

1. Setup Live Streaming on Youtube, create a channel, and create a **Private** Live Stream.
   * Name your Private stream **OOP-YourFirstName** such as *OOP-Fatalai*.
   * On your computer, configure streaming software with Settings for **reduced bandwidth**.
   * There is a separate document posted in Week 14 folder with help on doing this.

2. Practice using Live Streaming with Picture-in-Picture (so you can show a small webcam image).

3. On Google Drive for your KU account, create a folder to save uploaded videos.  Name the folder the same as your Live Stream: `OOP-YourName`.  It must be shared **only** with TA & instructor.  Share with these Google Accounts (replace "..." with KU domain)
   * dacharat.p@...
   * pawat.nak@...
   * triwith.m@...
   * j.brucker@...
   * Hint: another way to do this is: first create a Google Contact group named OOPTA and add the 4 Google ids to group.  Then you can use "OOPTA" in the share dialog.

4. Share your Private Live Stream with TA.  Paste the URL into the Google Form for this assignment.
   * Link to the Google Form is posted on Google Classroom along with this assignment.

5. Arrange a time with TA to view your Live Stream.  You only need to stream for a minute or two.  Check List:
    * video shows entire desktop
    * include IDE and type some code, so TA can check viewability
    * desktop includes a clock and TA can read the time (clock in status bar is OK if readable)
    * picture-in-picture of your smiling face

5. After streaming, upload the video to shared folder on Google Docs. We will check it.

6. TA will record result for Lab14 in Google sheet.  The easiest lab score ever!


## Lab 14 Part 2:  Add an Observer to Guessing Game

This is example of using the Observer Pattern with Java's built-in `Observer` and `Observable` classes.

I will post separate instructors for this.  

It is easy, fun, and does not require much time.
