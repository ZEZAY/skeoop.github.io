# Required Material for OOP

## Github Account

1. Create a Github account and complete your account profile.  Your profile should contain:
  * Your real name in English, at least first name. Use correct case of letters.
  * A photo that clearly shows your face.
2. 2nd-4th Year Students complete this form: [https://goo.gl/forms/uJU4wOJl0CJsJYhf1](https://goo.gl/forms/uJU4wOJl0CJsJYhf1).    
1st Year Students: don't need to complete form; we already have your Github login from last semester.

## Required Software

1. **Java SDK Version 8**.  We will use Version 8 in this course. Its OK if you *also* have Java 9 installed, but set Java 8 as the default in your IDE.
2. **The Java JDK Documentation** including the Java API docs installed on your computer, and *bookmarked* in a web browser. This is a great source of knowledge.  If you don't install it, you will not be able to look-up the Java API during a quiz or exam.
3. **Git command line client**.  You can use the IDE's built-in git feature, but you should also have the command-line git from https://git-scm.com
4. **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) for Java. Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJ are OK.

### Windows Users: Where to Install Java

* Install Java using a short directory path **without any spaces** in the path.
* Don't install Java or JDK docs on the desktop.
* Use a **short path** without any **space** in the name.
```
Good path: C:\java\jdk8u151 
Bad path:  C:\Program Files\Java\JavaSDK 8u151
Also bad:  C:\Users\admin\Local Files\Desktop\Eclipse
```

If you install Java software in a long path with spaces it is difficult to correctly add it to the PATH variable that is used in command windows.  It also makes it harder for you to find!

## Required Book

Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E.  Covers Java 7. The 4th edition can also be used; its almost identical and more concise but some section numbers differ.

## Recommended

1. BlueJ IDE from [https://bluej.org](https://bluej.org) . In BlueJ you can visualize code, interactively type and run code (without compiling), and inspect objects.
2. [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) from Oracle is great help learning how to do things in Java. There is a [download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) on the page to download it.  The "Really Big Index" page is the most efficient way to find things in the material, so bookmark it.
3. UML editor for drawing Class and Sequence diagrams.  There are UML extensions for Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ.  [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor I use in class. It doesn't draw Sequence Diagrams well, though.

## Suggested Books

* *Head First Java*, 2E. Entertaining, visual, and very memorable, but long.
* Wampler, *The Essence of Object-Oriented Programming with Java* (2001). Old, but really good explanation of O-O concepts.
* *Starting Out with Java*, 5E by Tony Gaddis.  Covers the same material as *Big Java* but more focused presentation. Also covers JavaFX.
* David Eck, *Introduction to Programming in Java* free online and downloadable PDF at [http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/).  Good but too long.  Prof. Eck has other free books you may like.
* Horstmann, *Object-Oriented Design and Patterns*, 2E (2006). Condensed from "Big Java" with more emphasis on OO concepts and design.  Many SKE graduates say this is the **best book**.  OOP students can borrow my copy.
* Horstmann, *Core Java for the Impatient*. Same material as the famous *Core Java* series, but more concise and more example code.
