**Password Encrypting** you should *never* store plain text password in a database, for security. Encrypt them!      
When the user sets a new password you encrypt it using a one-way hash.  The result is a String like "$a4$10$rb85CdE5982VrAZ873".
After that, each time the user enters his password you encrypt it using the same algorithm, and compare it with the original encrypted password. A simple library for this is [jBCrypt](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/).    

* [JBCrypt Demo Project](https://github.com/jbrucker/jbcrypt-demo) by Jim
* [Pawan's (OOP2017) Explanation](https://github.com/guitarpawat/course-feedback/blob/master/README.md) from his OOP2017 project. You should write documentation like this!
