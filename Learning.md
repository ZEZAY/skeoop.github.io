## Learning Java

### Online Courses

[Codecademy Learn Java][] partially free course covers Java basics. Has a nice interactive coding editor where you can enter Java code and have it evaluated.

[Udemy](https://udemy.com) has many Java courses, including some free ones.
    * Complete [Java Developer Course][] an in-depth course includes OOP. Looks like the best Udemy Java course but not free. Price 300 Bt (sale).

[Microsoft Java Courses on edX][]. Microsoft has 3 free courses on edX:
    * Learn to Program in Java
    * Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
    * Data Structures
    The courses are OK but don't cover very much.

[Coursera][] has some series courses using Java.  I haven't reviewed them thoroughly.  Interesting are:
    * [Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](duke-oop-java) 4-course series
    * 1: [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software][duke-java-programming] (Duke University)
        - has online resources page http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/index.php
        - uses BlueJ, Apache CSV, other open source
        - interesting projects

[edX](https://edx.org) some other good courses on edX are:
    * Java Programming Fundamentals by Galileo University


[Java Code Geeks][] a lot of Java learning material, some very advanced.  Not a good place to start learning Java, but useful when you want to know something in depth.

[Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org) by IntelliJ has interactive Java lessons and programming problems, rated by difficulty.  Some interesting problems:
    * Smart Calculator (medium)
    * Linear Equation Solver (medium)
    * Readability (hard)
    * Blockchain (nightmare)
    * Contacts (nightmare)

### Oracle Java Tutorial

[The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) a very extensive collection of tutorials covering the Java language.
 * [Download](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) the full tutorial and run on your computer, for easy access.
 * The *Really Big Index* is best place to find things. Bookmark it.

### Books

*Big Java* by Cay Horstmann. An easy to read book by professor who has written many Java books, including *Core Java*.  Sixth edition includes Java 8 streams, lambdas, and other features, but Fifth edition is good, too.

*Core Java for the Impatient* by Cay Horstmann.  More concise book on Java for people who know basic programming. Covers only the Java language, not O-O or programming concepts.  Useful as reference.


### Not so Good

[Learn Java Online](https://learnjavaonline.org) collection of Java tutorials, with interactive exercises. Some exercises look tedious and not very good code.

Interactive Java course in IntelliJ.  The course is repetitive and boring, spends too much time on trivial tasks.
